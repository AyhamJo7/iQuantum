* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug

### JavaScript Styleguide

* Use semicolons
* 2 spaces for indentation
* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Prefer arrow function syntax over function expressions
* Inline exports with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export const foo = 'bar';

  // Instead of:
  const foo = 'bar';
  export { foo };
  ```
* Place imports in the following order:
  * Built-in Node modules (such as `path`)
  * External modules (such as `axios`, `lodash`)
  * Internal modules (using relative paths)

### CSS Styleguide

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use dashes instead of camelCasing in class names
* Prefer selectors that are lower in specificity
* Avoid using IDs for styling
* When using multiple selectors in a rule declaration, give each selector its own line

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
