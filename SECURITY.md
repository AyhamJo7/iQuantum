## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to iQuantum, please keep the following security best practices in mind:

1. **Validate all inputs**: Never trust user input and always validate and sanitize it
2. **Avoid hardcoded secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets to the repository
3. **Use secure dependencies**: Be cautious when adding new dependencies and regularly update existing ones
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Code should only have access to the resources it needs
5. **Implement proper error handling**: Ensure errors are handled properly without leaking sensitive information
