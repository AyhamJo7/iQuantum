## üöÄ Deployment

### GitHub Pages

This project is designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages. Simply:

1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
3. Set the source to the main branch
4. GitHub Actions will automatically update the data daily

### Local Development

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-collection.git
cd ultimate-collection

# If you want to update the data
python scripts/main.py

# Serve the site locally (one of the following)
python -m http.server
# OR using npm
npx serve
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Data Extraction**: Scripts in the `scripts/` directory clone awesome lists repositories, parse their README.md files, and extract structured data.

2. **URL Validation**: All resources are filtered to ensure they have valid URLs, improving the quality of the collection.

3. **Web Interface**: A static HTML/CSS/JS application that loads the extracted data and provides a searchable interface.

## üîÑ Automated Updates

A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily to:

1. Clone/update the source awesome list repositories
2. Extract and filter the data
3. Update the JSON data files
4. Commit and push the changes to the repository

This ensures that the collection stays up-to-date with the latest resources from all included awesome lists.
